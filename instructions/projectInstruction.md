Submit a Python3 script named pred.py in the project final assignment on MarkUs.
 TODO: Provide pred.py with predict all function in the starter code.
 The script must include a function predict
 all that takes the name of a CSV file as a parameter
 and returns predictions for the data in the CSV file.
 Allowed Imports
 Your pred.py script can use the following imports: Python 3, numpy, pandas, and basic Python
 imports such as sys, csv, and random. However, it cannot import sklearn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
 Weencourage you to explore different families of models and build your final model using any tools,
 including sklearn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. You may reuse the code provided or written by you
 in any of the labs. However, your final pred.py script must generate predictions for the test data
 using your final model without using any of these imports (sklearn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow).
 Environment
 We will use Python 3.10 on the MarkUs system.
 Code Requirements

 Your code only needs to be able to make predictions. You can use any code or data to build
 your models.
 • You can submit additional files used by pred.py (e.g., to store your model parameters). All
 f
 iles combined should not exceed 10MB.
 • Your script should not require networking or download any new files.
 • Ensure your model script uses memory resources reasonably (TBD determine limit), and
 can make approximately 60 predictions within 1 minute (TBD when we get the test set).
