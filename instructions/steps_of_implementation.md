✅ Step-by-Step Plan
0. clean the data
1. Split the Data
Use the dataset you were given (from the survey responses) and split it into:

Training set (e.g., 80%)

Validation set (e.g., 20%)

You can do this using:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
2. Try Multiple Models with sklearn
Pick at least 3 model types (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP) and train them on X_train.

Example:


from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

models = {
    "Logistic": LogisticRegression(),
    "RandomForest": RandomForestClassifier(),
    "MLP": MLPClassifier()
}

for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    print(name, "Validation Accuracy:", model.score(X_val, y_val))
3. Pick the Best Model
Choose the one that performs best on the validation set, and make sure it’s not overfitting (e.g., don’t pick one that has 100% train accuracy but low validation accuracy).

4. Rebuild Final Model Without sklearn
Take the logic from the best model and re-implement it (or export its parameters) using only numpy/pandas for your final pred.py script.
