Data (2 points)
– Exploration: Present a thorough exploration of the data. For example, describe the
distributions of the features and how the features correlate with the target. The labs
contain examples of such explorations.
– Feature Selection: Explain how you determined your input features. Justify your
choice with logical or empirical evidence. Ensure that important features are not over-
looked or removed for “ease.”
– Data Representation: Describe how you represented the data in your models.
– Data Splitting: Describe how you split your data into various sets. If using k-fold
cross-validation, explain its application.
– Figures: Use figures where appropriate. Explain your interpretations of the figures.
– Consistency: Ensure the descriptions align with your .py and/or .ipynb files.


Univariate Analysis by Food Type:
Compare distributions of Q1 (complexity) across the three food types using boxplots
Analyze Q2 (ingredients) distribution with histograms for each food category
Visualize Q4 (price) distributions to identify pricing patterns
Show Q8 (hot sauce) preferences by food type
Feature Distributions:
Create barplots showing the serving settings (Q3) frequencies by food type
Analyze the most common drink pairings (Q6) for each food category
Visualize who each food reminds people of (Q7)
